Pre-11 Feb: python midi investigation, scales, chords
Feb 11: real-time midi for multiple simultaneous notes. basic generation.
Feb 13: read up on genetic algos

Problems: swing rhythm, 16 note chords overlapping, cutting each other off
Next primary goal: genetic algorithm implementation
Need clever crossover operators etc.

The genetic algorithm should operate on sets of 8 notes, designed to build off the last 8 (or more)
The fitness function should be designed to work over any amount of history, as when started, it only has the 
  genetic output to go on.
Need to pay attention to mutatorP, crossoverP etc.
