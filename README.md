This is my 2008 University of Bath dissertation on algorithmic
improvisation of jazz music.

The dissertation is also available online from the University of
Bath website:

Note that this is fairly old, and as such there are probably more relevant methods for producing algorithmic music nowadays - neural networks perhaps? The project was marked purely on the report (PDF) rather than the code, so it's understandably quite messy and not representative of my usual coding style!

The directories in the repository are:

* **root**: the dissertation PDF and poster PDF
* **dissertation**: LaTeX source files, accompanying images and source code.
* **midi**: example generated MIDI files. Not cherry-picked
* **misc**: Python implementation (abandoned for being too slow), pre-compiled classes in case I can't actually compile this again, and other files found lying about
* **src**: the Java source code
